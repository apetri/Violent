imgFetch.py
-----------

Takes a URL as input, connects to that URL and scans it for images; when it finds one it downloads it and searches for EXIF tags that can help with geolocation


imgGPS.py
---------

Same as imgFetch.py except that it works on local images and prints the complete GPS information
