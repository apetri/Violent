My Violent Python experiments
=============================

These code snippets are some experiments I conducted, which are based on the ideas contained in the book `Violent Python, a cookbook for Hackers, Foresnic Analysts, Penetration Testers and Security Engineers <http://www.amazon.com/Violent-Python-Cookbook-Penetration-Engineers/dp/1597499579>`_ by T.J. O'Connor.
